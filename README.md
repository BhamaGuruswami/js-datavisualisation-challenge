#  Data Visualisation Challenge
#### Objectives
> - DOM manipulation
> - AJAX/FETCH request
> - Using Third-party libraries
> - problem-solving : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
 > - Debugging using the console
> - Understand the notion of "separation of concerns"
#### Constraints
> -  You can't edit the html file.
> -  You have the choice of the type of graphics. Considers the most relevant based on the data and what story they can "tell".
> -  The choice of the javascript library is limited to the 2 libraries offered (there are many others, but these are references and are very popular)
#### Your mission

*1. Inline data (data in the document)*
> -  In this html file, you will find two data tables. Use JavaScript to traverse the DOM to insert right above each of these tables a representation of its data in the form of an interactive graph.
> -  If javascript is disabled, the graph does not appear. If javascript is enabled, the graph appears between the title and the table.

*2. Remote data, in real-time, via ajax*
> -  There are data sitting at this URL : https://canvasjs.com/services/data/datapoints.php
> -  Retrieve the data via Ajax, and use it to insert a graph that refreshes every second, just below the main title (h1) of the article.
> -  Don't hesitate to adapt the code provided in this tutorial: Live Updating Charts from JSON API & AJAX, but adapt it to this third-party library: chart.js or ToastUi-Chart, because this tutorial uses another (not-free) library (canvasJS).
